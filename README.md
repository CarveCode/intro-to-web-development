## What is this?

This is the first in what I hope to be a series of free books and videos that provide both an alternative and a supplement for web development bootcamps. It is an alternative for people who are unable to attend bootcamps because of scheduling conflicts or lack of money. It supplements a bootcamp experience by exploring areas of web development in greater depth than can be reached in a single course.

By the end of this first book, you will have a strong foundational understanding of web development. That foundation includes a working knowledge of the technologies that make up most websites, including HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In subsequent books and videos, I will take you through more advanced concepts and technologies that will help you become the kind of web developer anyone would want to hire.

## What this is not

* If you are looking to learn backend development \(code that runs on a web server\), you should look elsewhere. While there will be some discussion about the role servers play, I will primarily be focussing on frontend development \(the code that runs in your browser when you visit a website\). This is mostly due to the fact that backend development comes in so many varieties that it would be difficult to do even an introduction justice in a single book. If none of this make any sense, don't worry; I'll explain the difference between frontend and backend development in greater detail in the first chapter.

* This book will not by itself turn you into a professional web developer. I have found that books and videos are great for spreading knowledge, but are poor mediums for spreading skills. There is absolutely no substitute for getting your hands dirty and seeing what cool things you can do with your new-found knowledge. That's the only way any of what you learn will be of much use to you.

## What's the catch?

There is no catch. Of course that's what someone with a catch would say, but you'll just have to trust me. All of the content I create for CarveCode.com, I fully intend to make free for anyone who wants to learn. Throughout my career, I have been approached by friends and family who have asked me how they can learn to make websites. Many of them would like to get a job as a web developer but aren't sure where to begin. I'm writing this book for them, and if their desire resonates with you, then I'm writing this book for you, too.

Web development is a hot field right now. The demand for skilled developers is high, but the supply is low. This presents a unique opportunity for people who are willing to put forth the effort. For someone willing to go the distance, I can at least point the way.
